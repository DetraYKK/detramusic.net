Chorus:
I wish that I could take a peak
Into my own future
I wish to know if I get what I seek
If my dreams come true
I wish that I could take a peak
Into my own future
I wish to know if I get what I seek
If my dreams will come true

Verse 1:
Yeah, I often sit and wonder what my future holds
It's like this empty space inside of me I wish that I could see
I'm workin so damn hard
It would be nice to know where I'm going and if my dreams are coming true

Another day has come and another night has been
Everythin is so damn fuzzy, what will the future bring
Will the sun be shinin brightly down on me
Will I be headin to the top and get the crown on me
Will I be ridin around in limousines with ma own driver
With a martini in my hand and all the shrimp I can eat
Will I be livin in a house with my own swimmin pool
Near the beach, with a chance of playin volley ball

Chorus:
I wish that I could take a peak
Into my own future
I wish to know if I get what I seek
If my dreams come true
I wish that I could take a peak
Into my own future
I wish to know if I get what I seek
If my dreams will come true}
